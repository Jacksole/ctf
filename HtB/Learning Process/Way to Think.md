The field of information security is massive. It would be impossible for any one person to learn everything. Let's take the following example:

> Imagine you want to become a programmer, and you know that there are more than 200 different programming languages that can be used to create applications that can be cracked by debugging or reverse engineering. If you learned every programming language within 100 hours, you would spend 20,000 hours or 2,500 days (8 hours per day) or, in other words, almost 7 years to learn all of these programming languages. So you spent 7 years learning all these languages and never tried to debug or reverse engineer the program you created. Great! Let's spend another 7 years learning debugging and reverse engineering.

You've got the idea. No one wants to spend so much time on just one area. Furthermore, this isn't necessary. You will need some time to learn different technical principles, structures, and processes, but you won't need to spend 7 years on it. Every programming language has its own strengths and weaknesses. Also, if are able to obtain a deep understanding of a single programming language, you will be able to learn others much faster. You don't need to learn every programming language to understand how to read their code. All of them follow the same principles which were initially defined by R.D.Tennent:

> 1. The Principle of Abstraction
> 2. The Principle of Correspondence
> 3. The Principle of Data Type Completeness

In information security, you have to learn and understand these principles, structures, and processes quickly. Additionally, you have to adapt your knowledge to the various environments you encounter. You will have many situations where you won't understand how "it" works. That's good. At this point, you have to find out what you do not know. More about that later.

There are many learning-focused information security communities available to us. Many of these communities provide free reviews of tested applications, vulnerable machines, and guides to help each other and improve their members' skills. When you speak with the other members, you will notice there are generally two types of people.

> *  Those that do not know anything.
> *  Those who think they do not know anything.

This can be very frustrating, and this is a normal part of the learning process. Communication within these communities should be respectful, always keeping in mind that we all started with zero knowledge of this field. This is a critical point of success for the community and everyone learning and working in this field. Within Hack The Box you can use the Forum and Discord server to interact with the community.

Another important point is your knowledge level. Many people don't know their actual skill and knowledge level. This is a complicated topic because penetration testers must have a deep understanding of a wide variety of technologies. As previously mentioned, the problem in this field is the sheer volume of information available to us. You can learn about every topic and still not master any one area, or you can learn about just one topic and become an expert in it.

Another option is developing your research methodology, the learning process, and how to use this to improve your knowledge. You'll be successful if you know how to search for the required information on the internet, and you know how to learn fast and adapt it to the environment you're working on. However, before you can do this, you have to learn and practice how to do it.

You will become a good penetration tester only through considerable practice. There is no other way to improve your practical skills. For example, you can read 50 books about programming, and you will understand how to read the code. This is the process of passive learning. This can be useful, however, if you need to write your own program, you have to practice active learning, which means you have to write code and test it on your own.

One of the most common questions is:

> When is a penetration tester good enough?

We know that it is not possible for one person to know everything. In this case, we have to learn how to find, choose, and adapt the information we need.

Right now, you're considering these three key terms. There is one key term missing.

Which key term is missing from the above list?

The crucial missing term is: LEARN

The process of "learning how to learn" is not easy. Most people have never truly learned how to learn effectively. For example, in school, your teachers discussed some topics with your class. First, teachers show you just one way to solve a problem. They explained one way to solve the problem, and after that, they gave you exercises to practice further.

Let us take a closer look at the problem. Look at this simple math equation and try to solve it:

>	20 * ________+ ________ = 65535

This equation is easy to solve, but did you think about how many different ways are there to solve it?
