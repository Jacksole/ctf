# Attention

It can be said that attention is the perception of a specific topic with a higher level of interest in order to gather specific data and information from it.

Your attention changes with your experience and the information you gain from the content and its clarity.

Attention is influenced by your interests, needs, personal attitudes, beliefs, orientations, goals, and experiences.

You have already approached this module with a certain attitude, expectation, orientation, and goal. Attention is an independent mental process that takes place subconsciously.

So when we talk about concentration, we mean the maintenance of our attention on a specific topic. This means that as long as we are interested in a given topic, we keep working on it until we have achieved the desired result for our well-being. Again, attention goes hand in hand with concentration and focus.

You will already know that your attention will begin to decrease at some point, and you will no longer be able to absorb information effectively. Getting stuck at this point and forcing yourself to keep trying and learning usually ends up with problems of understanding and, therefore, with higher frustration.

Information security is a huge subject, as we have already discussed. You will not be able to absorb all the information at once. You will often come back to topics and repeat what you are missing. This is a normal process. It is vital that you understand how to divide your attention.

There is no general formula that you can use to learn how to divide your attention correctly. This is an individual process that cannot be categorized yet without diving too deep into psychology studies. There are far too many personal characteristics and experiences of each individual to be taken into account.

We know that attention takes place at the moment and therefore has a limited duration to maintain it. It will be a great advantage to find out how long and in which emotional state your attention span lasts the longest.

You can document it, and after one week, you will be able to see an interesting pattern. If you want to approach this on a more scientific level, you can add the following points to your documentation to get a better insight into it:

* current emotional state (calm, nervous, worried, happy, depressed, relaxed, ...)
* the previous flow of the day so far (also with one word)
* place of work
* working hours
* duration
* sleep
* inserted breaks
* duration of the breaks
* and anything else you can think of.

These are phases for which you must invest at least one hour of your attention. Make it fun, and you will surprise yourself with the discoveries that you make. You can create a simple list or even a table for you to document this quickly and easily. You don't have to document it every time you start something, but you could relate it to the current module/course/path.

Once you know how your attention span is behaving, you'll also get an idea of how you can split it up. However, this does not mean that if you have an attention span of 60 minutes, you can divide it between 3 other topics of 20 minutes each. Remember that the amount of attention you can devote to a particular topic depends on too many factors.

Experiment with this. Change your place of work, working hours, duration of work if possible. Listen to different music and try out different things that might help you.

It would be best if you didn't force yourself to focus on a specific topic because it will have a negative effect and, as mentioned before, can end up in frustration, which we will discuss in another section.

Make sure that you feel comfortable and ready to learn new things.
