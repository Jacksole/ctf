# Way Of Learning

So, why did you calculate it like this?

You performed the calculation it the way you learned it. That means you will use the patterns you have been conditioned to use. At this stage, as in the previous example with the calculation, you used the information you already had. This art of thinking, called "Outside the box," is an essential part of the "hacker mindset", or the way we must think as penetration testers to solve complex problems. To think outside the box means to see things outside of the limitations that have been placed on you. This means you have to be able to "pivot." We have to focus on so many different technologies during our penetration tests that it can become very confusing and frustrating when we don't understand some things.

> A problem is an emotional state. Without emotions, it is just a situation.

In other words, frustration and confusion come with the point of view you're looking at. The learning process isn't just a theoretical and practical part. It's also your learning process and progress that largely depends on your emotional state. If you feel good and you know you will reach your goal, you will be successful.

Another essential part that makes you successful is that you know your goal. Imagine the following scenario:

> You're standing still in a room, and your instructor instructs you to move across the room, and you start moving. After a while, the instructor put a chair in your way. What will you do? - You may sit down on this chair.

Now let us change the scenario a little bit.

> Your instructor instructs you to move to the other corner. You start moving, and the instructor puts a chair in your way again. What will you do?
> You will pass the chair and continue moving forward to the corner because you know your goal.

The big difference between these two scenarios is that you know your goal and know how you have to move. You will overcome the obstacles which are put in your way. If you don't have a goal, you will stop at the first obstacle. Without a goal, you will be disoriented moving from one topic to another.
