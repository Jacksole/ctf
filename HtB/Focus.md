# Focus
Let us dive a little deeper. This time we'll talk about focus, which is a vital skill that we need. However, like many other abilities, it is a double-edged sword. When we talk about focus, we are talking about focusing on a subject for a specific time. When we focus on a subject, we concentrate most of our thinking and attention on the chosen topic. In doing so, all other thoughts concerning other topics will be completely faded out.

Have you ever wondered why most frustrated people go straight to the gym after a stressful day instead of just lying down and doing nothing? Why do they feel better afterward? Often you hear from them that they absolutely need it to calm down again. If you think about it a bit, it seems illogical at first because they need additional physical energy in an exhausted state.

This raises again the question: "Why further physical effort helps them to calm down?"

On the one hand, so-called endorphins (happiness hormones) are produced by the body when doing workouts. These have different effects on the body, and one of them is the reduction of pain. Also, the chemical transmitters have a calming effect and ensure a restful sleep. Another function is the formation and regulation of hunger. You probably know the latter from sports. As soon as you have exhausted yourself, the feeling of hunger comes. Another beneficial effect of endorphins is the strengthening of the immune system, not only on the physical but also on the psychological level.

This may explain why you feel better afterward, but after all, the most significant stress is not in the body but the mind. We know that after sports, the body is exhausted, but why does your mind start to relax? During the workout, you are entirely focused on the physical exercises since these usually require a large amount of energy that also requires your full focus. As the focus turns away from the actual stress, we let go of the situations that have stressed us so much, and these are subconsciously processed and, for the most part, solved. Here is an excellent example of such a situation that you have probably experienced by yourself:

> You have probably forgotten where you put something, or you can't think of a specific term that is so obvious to you. Have you ever asked yourself why you can suddenly remember it after a short time?

You distracted yourself and focused on a different topic. With that, you gave your subconscious the possibility to solve the problem by itself.

It is important to differentiate between focus and attention because they are not the same. Attention refers to the momentum, as it is happening right now, and you are reading this text. However, the focus is on the topic you are dealing with at the moment. When we return to the example of the misplaced keys, try to remember what was going through your mind. Most likely, it was something like:

> "Where did I put the keys?" or "Where did I last see them?"

If these were the questions you were asking yourself, you could see from the questions alone that it is the subject of the keys, and therefore your focus was on finding the keys.

If you have been in the situation where you said to yourself at the same time:

> "OK, the keys are not here..."

then you had your complete attention on searching for the keys. However, what if you are in a hurry?

Then you look at your watch every 5 seconds, and your thoughts are already on where you are expected to be soon. You will hardly be able to concentrate on the search for the keys because your focus is on "being late" and not on "finding the keys." It should have become a bit clearer that focus and attention are not the same, and that attention is influenced by focus.

The focus is based on your will and what you want to achieve. It can be a conscious decision and a subconscious decision guided by external influences.

Focusing is the purposeful and deliberate alignment to a specific goal.

Focused people are not only enormously persistent and tenacious, but they are also hardly distracted or discouraged. If we know our goal, it is easier to align our focus accordingly. This, in turn, makes us much more efficient, and we get closer to our goal much faster and do not let ourselves be distracted by external influences
